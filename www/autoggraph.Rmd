a tool for simplifying routine data visualization.

## problem:
Data visualization at GAO is currently highly-labor intensive:

- The tools VCAs use to create graphs don't play nicely with the tools analysts use.
	- This poses a particular challenge to data-intensive graphs.
- Changes from the quality assurance process may result in hours of rework for VCAs.

## solution:

autoggraph, a shiny application that wraps an R package for producing plots.

- Analysts closest to the data can be in charge of generating plots.
- Plots can be automatically generated to meet GAO graphics standards.
- Export features enable specialists to do additional customizing as needed.

Additionally, autoggraph provides a platform for educating users about how to make  
the data visualization choices that best communicate their message.

## roadmap

### user testing

We think it's important to get feedback from potential users, to better understand how further work on the application can help meet their needs, and to make sure that the documentation we develop will answer the questions real users have.

### outreach

We'll want to make sure that affected parties have a chance to have input, including:

- VCAs
- OPA
- CDMA
- ISTS

### further development

- additional graphics types
	- maps
	- harvey balls
	- hierarchical data representations

- graph recommendations
- basic interactivity
